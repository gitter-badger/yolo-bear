My dear friend:

>We meet again! Hope you have fun with this lovely *yolo-bear*.

I am **ColdZoo**, I hereby offer you this pack of source codes. It is a collection of tiny projects which described at [my blog][1]. As an independent developer, I am afraid I can't offer you more warranty than tech-support. If you found yourself confused when reviewing my code, I strongly suggest you utter your voice on the [blog][1].

Sharing is a great thing, The purposes of building this repository are firstly, collect my own tiny projects,secondly,share with you.If I am lucky enough to be able to help you out of one or two tech problems, Feel free to add a **star** at the [*github* page][2].

	Right now, I am mainly interested in becoming an expert of Machine Learning.I already did some work in the field of Computer Vision. Even thought I am only an amateur, I believe in my perseverance.
	
##Q&A
###Is the source code here available  for commercial purpose?

To be honest, it won't bother me if you apply my work here into your company's project. But as I may have used other's library or toolbox, before you doing so, I suggest you ask for their permission.

###You are only an amateur, what can you do for me?
I am learning and I am learning fast. I keep going, Aspiring for the final direction.
